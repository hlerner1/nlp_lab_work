Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.Written for J.R.R. Tolkien’s own children, The Hobbit met with instant critical acclaim when it was first published in 1937. Now recognized as a timeless classic, this introduction to the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, the wizard Gandalf, Gollum, and the spectacular world of Middle-earth recounts of the adventures of a reluctant hero, a powerful and dangerous ring, and the cruel dragon Smaug the Magnificent.

After many ages it fell by chance into the hands of the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.From Sauron's fastness in the Dark Tower of Mordor, his power spread far and wide. Sauron gathered all the Great Rings to him, but always he searched for the One Ring that would complete his dominion.When Bilbo reached his eleventy-first birthday he disappeared, bequeathing to his young cousin Frodo the Ruling Ring and a perilous quest: to journey across Middle-earth, deep into the shadow of the Dark Lord, and destroy the Ring by casting it into the Cracks of Doom.The Lord of the Rings tells of the great quest undertaken by Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the Wizard; the hobbits Merry, Pippin, and Sam; Gimli the Dwarf; Legolas the Elf; Boromir of Gondor; and a tall, mysterious stranger called Strider."", 'characters': ['Frodo Baggins', 'Meriadoc Brandybuck', 'Peregrin Took', 'Gandalf', 'Aragorn', 'Gimli', 'Boromir', 'Bilbo Baggins', 'Treebeard', 'Saruman', 'Éowyn', 'Éomer', 'Elrond Half-elven', 'Arwen Undómiel', 'Galadriel', 'Faramir', 'Gollum', 'Legolas', 'Sam Gamgee']}","{'title': 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia, #1)', 'author': 'C.S.

But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all.

Snyder did when he joined it;• German atrocities toward captured crew and civilians;• behind-the-scenes stories of the Belgium civilians who risked all to save American flyers who were in the air one moment, spiraling down in flames the next;• creation and dedication of the monument to the Susan Ruth and its crew located in Macquenoise, Belgium in 1989.Shot Down was created from the vast number of letters and journals of Howard Snyder; diaries of men and women on the ground who rescued, sheltered and hid the crew; and interviews conducted by historians. Centered around the 306th Bomb Group in Thurleigh, England, it is informative, insightful and captivating.For most, 70 years is a long time ago. World War II fades in importance as each year goes by.

Hopefully, I have captured some of those few moments of pure happiness, humour and joy which I believe will not only help other people touched by cancer but will show sufferers and their families that there is no right or wrong way to behave, just as long as you continue to show how much you care and as much as possible, be there for each other.', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'The Octunnumi Fosbit Files Prologue', 'author': 'Trevor Alan Foris', 'book summary': ""ONLY AVAILABLE FROM; www.the-octunnumi.comPublishers note;The Octunnumi does not exist.Fosbit and any files relating to a Fosbit do not exist.The Tarelen peoples that protect and provide sanctuary for the Avitens of Fethrist are not real.The abilities of the Tarelen peoples with their heightened skills, living in their Utopian world are myth, their purpose here mere tales; rumours of their reincarnations enabling them to live many lives… ridiculous!And there is definitely no magic.None at all.No, really, there isn’t.Magic is not a thing.There are also no hidden worlds or mythical beings coexisting just out of sight.

Beneath the towering bleached ribs of a dead, ancient beast lies New Crobuzon, a squalid city where humans, Re-mades, and arcane races live in perpetual fear of Parliament and its brutal militia. The air and rivers are thick with factory pollutants and the strange effluents of alchemy, and the ghettos contain a vast mix of workers, artists, spies, junkies, and whores. In New Crobuzon, the unsavory deal is stranger to none—not even to Isaac, a brilliant scientist with a penchant for Crisis Theory.  Isaac has spent a lifetime quietly carrying out his unique research. But when a half-bird, half-human creature known as the Garuda comes to him from afar, Isaac is faced with challenges he has never before fathomed. Though the Garuda's request is scientifically daunting, Isaac is sparked by his own curiosity and an uncanny reverence for this curious stranger.  While Isaac's experiments for the Garuda turn into an obsession, one of his lab specimens demands attention: a brilliantly colored caterpillar that feeds on nothing but a hallucinatory drug and grows larger—and more consuming—by the day. What finally emerges from the silken cocoon will permeate every fiber of New Crobuzon—and not even the Ambassador of Hell will challenge the malignant terror it invokes . . .

Započeta davno pre Gospodara prstenova, ovo je priča iz Prvog razdoblja Tolkinovog sveta, drevna drama na koju se likovi iz Gospodara prstenova osvrću, i u kojoj su neki od njih, poput Elronda i Galadrijele, i učestvovali.Naziv Silmarilion skraćeno je od „Kventa Silmarilion”, ili „Istorija Silmarila”, tri velika dragulja koja je stvorio Feanor, najdarovitiji od Vilovnjaka, i u kojima je zarobio svetlost Dva Drveta koja je obasjavala Valinor, zemlju bogova. Kada je Morgot, prvi Mračni Gospodar, uništio Drveće, ta svetlost je živela još samo u Silmarilima; Morgot ih je ugrabio i postavio u svoju krunu, čuvanu u neprobojnoj tvrđavi Angband na severu Srednjeg sveta. Silmarilion je istorija pobune Feanora i njegovog naroda protiv bogova, njihovog progona iz Srednjeg sveta i njihovog rata, beznadežnog uprkos svem junaštvu Vilovnjaka i Ljudi u borbi protiv velikog Neprijatelja.Silmarilion obuhvata pet knjiga: „Ainulindale” je mit o stvaranju sveta; „Valakventa” je knjiga u kojoj su izloženi priroda i moći svakog od bogova; posle „Silmariliona”, koji je treća po redu knjiga, sledi „Akalabet”, priča o padu velikog ostrvskog carstva Numenor, na kraju Drugog razdoblja; i knjigu završava „O Prstenovima moći i Trećem razdoblju”, gde se ukratko prikazuju okolnosti iz kojih su se izrodili događaji kasnije opisani u Gospodaru prstenova.Ovo novo izdanje Silmariliona sadrži prerađen i dopravljen tekst „drugog izdanja”, a kao uvod je uvršteno pismo koje je Dž.

When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape. Matters do not go as planned—Cora kills a young white boy who tries to capture her. Though they manage to find a station and head north, they are being hunted.In Whitehead’s ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor—engineers and conductors operate a secret network of tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora and Caesar’s first stop is South Carolina, in a city that initially seems like a haven. But the city’s placid surface masks an insidious scheme designed for its black denizens. And even worse: Ridgeway, the relentless slave catcher, is close on their heels. Forced to flee again, Cora embarks on a harrowing flight, state by state, seeking true freedom.Like the protagonist of Gulliver’s Travels, Cora encounters different worlds at each stage of her journey—hers is an odyssey through time as well as space. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors for black people in the pre–Civil War era, his narrative seamlessly weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day.

Yet through all that he offers encouragement and inspiration to those millions of others who also experience anxiety and panic.There are many books on the market about anxiety, yet just a quick glance at these will demonstrate just how chintzy, patronising and condescending they really are. All these books give the impression that a few simple exercises can hold the terrors of tension, misery and dread at bay. If only it was that easy. But it’s not. Anxiety can cripple you! And there’s no easy cure, or magic words, or wrist band that is ever going to work We start the book as Danny takes stock of those around him, and as editor of the book, before we get into more serious matters, I’ve allowed Danny 15 quick-fire poems to introduce himself, his Gypsy lifestyle as a kid and where he finds himself at the moment. He begins to notice loss, although he never phrases it quite like that. But we see loss as children fly the nest, loss of his youthful good looks and energy, a possible loss of income and finally the loss of a friend of ours, Chalkie, who was brutally murdered.Our mate, Chalkie, was a great friend to Danny, and when he was savagely murdered it sent Danny into dark places in his mind that he had trouble escaping from. Danny was very much aware that he was in danger of turning corners in the labyrinth of his mind that he may not be able to find his way out of.Danny has become a student of the human condition, and in this book he does what he does best; write poems about the world around him, and he does this with passion. Even if poems aren’t your preferred treasure, even if they don’t normally grab you, if they’re not your ‘thing,’ I’d still ask that you bear with Danny as he tells his story in his own way, for this, some would say, is what happens when someone with anxiety digs deep down into his own soul, for the book looks into the nitty-gritty of mental health awareness as Danny tells his story in a unique way, as he learns to come to terms with the barbaric and vicious murder of his best mate. Although, of course, he never does come to terms with such a cruel act. You can’t. Sometimes Danny is, to use his own words, all lopsided in his head, which is why I’ve chosen to present the book in the current format, to expose how his thinking bounces around without rhyme or reason. So he discusses anxiety and depression and suicide and then out of the blue he writes a poem, but poetry is Danny’s way of clearing his head.What can I tell you about Danny? He has a ferocious spirit and vigour. He has high moods and an instinctive ability to perceive and understand the world around him. He has a fierce sense of loyalty, he’s romantic, quixotic and starry-eyed. He brings smiles to everyone he meets, a gift I truly believe comes from a higher source. However, there’s no denying that at times he can be restless, carrying the capacity for vastly darker moods, melancholy energies and occasional bouts of madness. Writers, poets, artists, musicians and circus clowns often suffer from boisterous and raucous dispositions. And it’s true they can get into trouble at times. They wear their moods as their ships of passage, and Danny is no different. He suffers from what Lord Byron would term a ‘fine madness.’ He throws out poems in a sparkle of energy. And he puts everything into the words. They just arrive on paper as though a higher being is working through him. I can’t explain this, but it’s how it happensI’ve known Danny for over 40 years, since we shared a room together at a seaside town in the South coast of England. So my opinion? He’s probably a bit of a mad genius, slowly losing his sanity, although he loves the world and everyone in it, and if this book can help just one person then Danny will sleep with a smile on his face tonight.

Anything anyone tells her to do, Ella must obey. Another girl might have been cowed by this affliction, but not feisty Ella: ""Instead of making me docile, Lucinda\'s curse made a rebel of me. Or perhaps I was that way naturally."" When her beloved mother dies, leaving her in the care of a mostly absent and avaricious father, and later, a loathsome stepmother and two treacherous stepsisters, Ella\'s life and well-being seem to be in grave peril. But her intelligence and saucy nature keep her in good stead as she sets out on a quest for freedom and self-discovery as she tries to track down Lucinda to undo the curse, fending off ogres, befriending elves, and falling in love with a prince along the way. Yes, there is a pumpkin coach, a glass slipper, and a happily ever after, but this is the most remarkable, delightful, and profound version of Cinderella you\'ll ever read.Gail Carson Levine\'s examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him. Ella Enchanted has won many well-deserved awards, including a Newbery Honor.', 'characters': ['Ella Varner', 'Lucinda', 'Mandy', 'Prince Charmont', 'Areida', 'Hattie', 'Olive Abroholos Elephanta']}","{'title': 'The City & the City', 'author': 'China MiÃ©ville', 'book summary': 'When a murdered woman is found in the city of Beszel, somewhere at the edge of Europe, it looks to be a routine case for Inspector Tyador Borlú of the Extreme Crime Squad. But as he investigates, the evidence points to conspiracies far stranger and more deadly than anything he could have imagined.Borlú must travel from the decaying Beszel to the only metropolis on Earth as strange as his own. This is a border crossing like no other, a journey as psychic as it is physical, a shift in perception, a seeing of the unseen. His destination is Beszel’s equal, rival, and intimate neighbor, the rich and vibrant city of Ul Qoma. With Ul Qoman detective Qussim Dhatt, and struggling with his own transition, Borlú is enmeshed in a sordid underworld of rabid nationalists intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists who dream of dissolving the two into one. As the detectives uncover the dead woman’s secrets, they begin to suspect a truth that could cost them and those they care about more than their lives. What stands against them are murderous powers in Beszel and in Ul Qoma: and, most terrifying of all, that which lies between these two cities.Casting shades of Kafka and Philip K.

Mohamed Reza Pahlavi followed his father Reza Shah’s vision to make Iran the leading power in the Middle East. He wanted his country once again to become as powerful as the Great Persian Empire of the past. He believed that by developing industry, education, economics, and the military, his dream could come to fruition. He was also a sportsman and realized that his people needed leisure time, and so he encouraged and supported sports activities. The Iran of the 60’s and 70’s was a country with the most beautiful snow skiing in the world; it had a world-renowned soccer program; there were country clubs and civic parks with golf courses, tennis courts, swimming pools, and just about every activity anyone might want.  The Shah’s true love, however, was horses. Perhaps as a result, he promoted and supported all types of equestrian activities. An invitation to work for the Imperial Court as his horse trainer enabled the author to see many of the royal family in informal moments; it also gave her an entrée into high society, and this enabled her to observe the upper class of Iranians at play. Many of the generals and court officials spent much time in Tehran and the coastal resorts junketing and enjoying many different sports, indulging themselves to the fullest. This is a book of stories and anecdotes about her life there during the “Golden Years” of the reign of Mohammed Reza, Shahanshah Aryamehr. There were times of joy, fun, stress, accomplishment and sadness during her time in that beautiful Middle Eastern country.

Der Käufer aller Teppiche des Planeten ist der Kaiser, gottgleich und unsterblich, für dessen Palast die unbezahlbaren Kunstgegenstände bestimmt sind. Die Perspektive wechselt, und plötzlich findet sich der Leser im Orbit des Planeten wieder. Dort befindet sich ein Expeditionsraumschiff, das in diesen bisher unbekannten Sektor der Galaxie vorgedrungen ist und dessen Pilot nun beschließt auf dem Planeten zu landen um mehr Informationen zu sammeln. Kurz nach seiner Ankunft wird er jedoch gefangengenommen, denn er verbreitet die ""ketzerische"" Nachricht, der Kaiser sei schon seit langem gestürzt und die Rebellen hätten die Menschen von ihrem Joch befreit. Dies paßt natürlich überhaupt nicht ins Weltbild der Einheimischen, denn für die Festigung der Macht des Kaisers sorgen planetenweit umherwandernde Priester ... doch vor seinem Verschwinden kann der Pilot noch eine Mitteilung über die Haarteppiche an sein Schiff schicken. Nach einiger Zeit wird die Suche nach ihm aufgegeben und die Sache mit den Teppichen wäre nur eine Kuriosität geblieben, wenn nicht Hunderte anderer Planeten entdeckt worden wären, auf denen das gleiche faszinierende Handwerk weit verbreitet ist. Doch in dem Palast des Kaisers -- der in der Tat gestürzt wurde -- wird kein einziger dieser Teppiche gefunden und immer noch holen Schiffe die fertiggestellten Produkte ab. Was also geschieht mit den Teppichen? Die Antwort wird am Ende des Buches offenbart, doch bis dahin erfährt man noch viel mehr Hintergründe: die Geschehnisse, die zum Sturz des Kaisers führten, genauso wie Einblicke in die Kultur des Planeten ... und immer wieder nimmt die Handlung überraschende Wendungen.

Durch andauernde Sprünge in Erzählperspektive sowie Zeitlinie weiß der Autor den Leser bis zum Ende zu fesseln, bis schließlich die vielen Mosaike ein großes Bild ergeben ... auch wenn die Auflösung und einige andere Aspekte vielleicht mehr mit Fantasy als mit Science Fiction zu tun haben. Alles in allem wirklich empfehlenswert, besonders weil sich die Story erfrischend vom Durchschnitt abhebt. --Oliver Faulhaber', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'Terrier (Beka Cooper, #1)', 'author': 'Tamora Pierce', 'book summary': 'Hundreds of years before Alanna first drew her sword in Tamora Pierce\'s memorable debut, Alanna: The First Adventure, Tortall had a heroine named Beka Cooper - a fierce young woman who fights crime in a world of magic.

Against her better judgment, Altair Jones, 17, rescues an unconscious man from a canal near her poleboat. She is fascinated by Mondragon's good looks and elegant ways and begins to fall in love with him. Even though she knows there is no future for a water rat like herself with such a man, she decides to watch over him and rescue him from his enemies; enemies who turn out to be the most powerful people in the upper city. Cherryh is well known for her skill at creating complex and believable societies and worlds, as is shown by this book's 40-page appendix of maps and essays that cover everything from Merovingen's history to its monetary system.

The answer is simple: the mages stole the magic from this land and used its power to create a new one. This new land was an island, Mornisle, set in the sea off the east coast of England. They drained the land of all magic and hid their new Isle behind a protective bubble, forged from magic and known as the Shield. No one knew the Isle was there; boats could pass by or through it, with no awareness of its presence. As the old world moved on and technologies advanced, planes could fly over it and satellites could scan the sea, but no trace of it would ever be seen, so strong was the magic protecting it. And it is still there today. Veyla has lived all her life on the east coast of England, always believing that she was born there, and was normal teenager. The day a stranger arrives and tells her the truth of her birth, her ancestry and her legacy, changes her life forever. She is a princess of one of the most powerful royal families on the Isle, brought to this world by her father in an attempt to protect her. But her father has disappeared, and so she returns to the place of her birth, with just her father’s groom as her guide.

Unfortunately, such conditions are not ideal for 18-year-old Nira Dharni and her boyfriend, Taren Tasmin. The two of them have been in a happy relationship for five years, but now, every human and genopet in their clan has been slaughtered by the ruthless Firefang Clan. While Nira is adopted by a new clan, Taren is forced to join the Firefang Clan and aid them in their plot to dominate the other clans, including Nira’s. Thus, Nira’s love for Taren and their desire to continue seeing each other, despite their segregation into separate clans, will put their relationship, their genopets, and the entire societal structure of genopet clans at stake."", 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'Red Sister (Book of the Ancestor, #1)', 'author': 'Mark  Lawrence', 'book summary': 'I was born for killing – the gods made me to ruin.At the Convent of Sweet Mercy young girls are raised to be killers.

When I’m not singing, fighting, reading, watching or engaged in something fantasy I’m imagining it. I even dream fantasy.That’s why, one night when this huge ball of lightning rolls over me and, next minute, I’m someplace (N’arth) and sometime else (2000 years in my future), I’m convinced I’m dreaming. One of my classic duel dreams where I fight the baddy and I win!When I can’t sing, lose the duel, and don’t wake up after a really hard fall, I start to believe this old guy, Nuselmir.He’s the one who brought me to N’arth. He says he’s a scientist from an advanced planet, destroyed by his brother Fircule, and now Fircule’s trying to destroy N’arth. He’s convinced that only one person can save this world, Princess Raylene. Big problem, some childhood trauma caused her to become mute and withdrawn. In desperation, Nuselmir put her genetic markers in a device called a Dron and used it to locate someone who looks like her and could impersonate her‒me and then swaps us. Oh, yeah, my Mum and Dad will love that.So, he drags me to this other place, where toilet paper hasn’t been invented yet and expects me to be her. No way! Not my monkey! That is until I learn of Fircule’s Big Plan to Destroy the Universe. N’arth is just the beginning, Earth is next on his list. The sooner I do what I have to do, the sooner I can get back to Earth and warn it of Fircule’s plan.The fantasy becomes reality but it’s not that easy. Nuselmir hasn’t got a plan. Just impersonate Raylene. Great. And there’s so much he doesn’t tell me, like why nobody likes Raylene. Not only have I been transported to a new place I’ve got no friends and I can’t sing. It’s tough, really tough. Except for the training with the sword, that I do pretty well at. BTW, Sword Master is not impressed when I searched the armoury and choose the king’s boyhood sword.Things go from tough to unbearable when my ‘father’ King Alexander visits Nuselmir’s island keep and tries to get me killed—twice. Oh, and thanks Nuselmir but, if I die on N’arth that’s it. I’m dead. The king leaves the keep believing I’m dead and this is the thing that changes everybody’s mind about me. So, I don’t actually have friends, but I do have respect and loyalty from the servants and soldiers and this inspires me to look out for them.If the king finds out I’m still alive...I search maps and plans and eventually find a place for us all to escape to, a cave accessed through a secret passage that starts in my room. We barely get away before the king’s assassins strike.Five of us. Me, of course. Yannah, my maid and Raylene’s childhood friend. Dieter, a bastard kitchen hand. Brghyn a humanoid alien. And an unconscious Nuselmir.We can’t do anything to rouse Nuselmir and decide to find the Red One, a reclusive healer who might live near the Ridge, where Brghyn’s race live. It’s my idea to disguise ourselves and hopefully avoid detection on the road by the king’s soldiers.The journey is fraught with danger and deprivation, but we eventually make it to the city of Pleth, where I meet a really old guy called Sim. In a soundproof room, he teaches me the Last Song, embeds a clear crystal in my sword, and dies.Fircule must have heard the singing—which isn’t surprising because he’s the one who used a Dron to stop singing in the first place. He sends his mate Herlon to grab me, only I’m with Yannah this time, and takes us to Herlon’s Nodal Mines. We are three months in the mines where the task of killing the life source of N’arth nearly kills me.Why do I obey Herlon?How do we escape?Do Brghyn, Dieter and Nuselmir find the Red One.What happened to the real Raylene?Why me?Who saves N’arth?Read The Lost to join me on my adventure and find the answers to these questions.', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': ""Maggie's Dream"", 'author': 'Leslie Tall Manning', 'book summary': '""This is a weird and wondrous book!

He tasted the same soft, malty sweetness of her mouth, feeling the fullness of her lips as they flowered beneath his. Her body curved into his, her fingers gripping his knuckles. He heard her same, muted sigh of pleasure as their joined hands collapsed between them, and he felt the same heady rush as they collided into each other.\n\nBut this time was different, too. He resisted the urge to run his hands down her body, to gather her against him. Before, he had been too intoxicated by the taste of her to wonder if she could handle the full extent of his passion; this time, he was overwhelmed, but he was all too aware of what it was like to lose her.\n\nThe equal power of their magic diminished as he began to be consumed. It could have been years or seconds since their last meeting; he had wanted her then, and he only wanted her more now.\n\nThe engines behind them sparked; the ship began to sink. Brixton felt his own destruction become increasingly inevitable before she reluctantly tore herself away from him.\n\nHis voice was a husky whisper as he stared into the silver seas of Adelaide’s gaze. “I’ve missed you.”\xa0\n\xa0\xa0\nWHAT READERS ARE SAYING:\xa0\n\n""I\'ve certainly loved every minute of this story, and I can\'t wait for the next book in this series!"" ~ Pris, Goodreads Reviewer""An interesting and enjoyable historical, steam-punk story full of magic, dragons, legends, history, friendship, family, loyalty and love."" ~ Zany Bibliophile Book Blog Review', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'صراع الملكات - لج 4', 'author': 'Osamah M.

They are the inheritors of a great literature. Their “loremasters” wander around Tond, seeking knowledge, and wielding the powers of “mechanas”, items left from before the destruction.The Karjans were originally invaders and conquerors into Tond, and have only recently sought peace with the Fyorians. They are great architects and builders, and they are skilled in warfare. Their “Imperium” stretches across much of southern Tond. They are also known as musicians, artists, and craftsmen.As these two make a tentative peace, a larger threat is growing. The Fyorian loremasters can see it with their mysterious Eye, one of the Ancients’ mechanas – but they refuse to acknowledge it because it is using a power they have forbidden and attempted to hide from all others.

These times are part of everyone's spiritual journey. In the Bible Jesus tells us that in the world we will have trials and tribulations (John 16:33) but He also instructs us to be of good cheer because our struggles will not overcome us. Despite Jesus' words, some people in the Church struggle with their faith in times of crisis. They mumble, they mummer, and give up on God after basing their faith on what is happening to them and around them. The key to overcoming the challenges of life is to keep our eyes on Jesus and His unconditional love for us. When we begin to understand Jesus love for us we began to inwardly develop the strength we need to make it through any challenge. When we make Jesus the object of our faith, the center of our attention, our faith spontaneously grows. That is because as we focus on Jesus we can see His track record, where He has so ever remained faithful in seeing us through. Relying on Jesus is the key to sustaining our faith and maintaining our Christian walk. Many books on the market today, offer a collection of encouraging sermons, personal life stories, and self-help material all aimed at encouraging those who are struggling with their faith. This book of poems however will be a collection of short poems that can act as personal everyday faith confessions. Rather than reading an encouraging sermon from a chapter out of a book, this poetry collection will offer short sections that readers can easily navigate too, remember, and even sing to themselves throughout the day as they encourage themselves. The collection of poems within this book is written in a popular, conventional style. The different poetic structures and lyrics makes it easily accessible to those who don't know much about the Bible, while providing a message that is evangelical, theologically accurate, and culturally relatable.

Members of the MWC InterGalactic Council decide that a liaison, dubbed the Chief Communicator (CC) must be contacted and that this contact must be made public in order to avert multiple types of disasters on Earth. As a “Spanner,” Clara is one of millions of “Baby Boomers” who survive across two centuries and bridge the divide (hence, “Spanners”) between nonpublic and public contact with the MWC and many other major changes that occur during these decades. Because most Earthers are not prepared to accept this type of reporting or storytelling as nonfiction, this first and some other volumes of the series are of the realistic fiction/science fiction/fantasy/ romance genres. Many of the characters, events and locations are actual; some are not, or haven’t happened (yet) at the time of first publication. In ""This Changes Everything"" are: a love story, spanning about 40 years; dialogue and scenes of the relationships among the CC and her mother and siblings; communications between the CC and her adult son; dialogue between the CC and some friends; info about the selection and identity of the chosen media contact for the CC, with excerpts from her journal; news stories about the CC and the MWC events from Earth media as well as MWC media; background about the CC and the reasons for her being selected; excepts from minutes of meetings of the InterGalactic Council of the MWC; and much more. After the MWC educational resources and information become widely available, in 2013, all time is now known to be simultaneous.

To all Mindfulness and Alchemy Explorers who see the beauty in every-day Nature & Universal sacred language of symbols and signs. We will not talk about spiritual symbols worshiped by major religions but about trees, numbers, spirals that we meet daily. Through symbols to mindfulness meditations. Symbols and signs are the languages of the soul. Symbols and signs are the language of dreams. Occultists believe that signs and symbols are given a supernatural power at their creation. Words, signs and symbols, images, colors, light, are all used for eons to convey a spiritual meaning. The Mystics of India In ancient India yogis observed the world as an illusion. Yet, the magic of the spiritual world stayed deeply connected to the sense world. Within the science of yoga, the way we treat our spine influences our health and well-being, the way we treat our thoughts, or the practice of meditation influences our current incarnation. The Mystics of Greece For the philosophers of ancient Babylonia and Greece the sense world was not considered an illusion. In the search for Divine, they turned towards art, towards symbols and signs within myths and legends. In mysterious ways the wisdom of the initiates poured into poets, artists, and thinkers. Manipulating the elements, they turned towards the Lady Science and carried her principles to the point that we are now able to manipulate the sound, the light, the matter and its manifestation. The Mystics of China Chinese created I Ching that within its symbolism reflects the universe in miniature. The book is at the heart of Confucian thought and Taoism, but also a common tool among the fortune tellers that use it as a divination text and a roadside oracle. The Mystics of Kabbalah Kabbalists designed the Tree of Life and the Tarot symbolism followed it. Kabbalah is an esoteric teaching, a science that explores metaphysical principles of the universe. Any material object and action from both the micro and the macro world is controlled by the spiritual forces. Kabbalah attempts to understand these spiritual sources, to know their nature and properties. Mystics Magic and God To a Chinese sage, a Yogi, and a Cabbalist Mystic, the earth is a field of activity that has to be transformed, so that it carries an imprint of human will. The Mystics, the Magi initiates, the guardians of the oracle mysteries acquired deep knowledge of the laws of the spiritual world and their interaction with the sense world. Some of them worked hard all through their lives to decipher the spiritual forces behind the forces of nature and to learn how to control the elements. Just as God is hidden, so are the inner secrets of Her divine message. We read about them, hear them uttered, but we cannot possibly comprehend their meaning unless we have a direct experience of their truth. That is why to be able to talk to our souls we use meditation, we use rituals, symbols and signs, we use dreams and careful observation of souls’ subconscious messages. The mystics of our past help us in this quest. From Zarathustra who comes from the ancient Persian spiritual culture, to Pythagoras who comes from the Greco-Latin cultural epoch, to Lao Tzu, Buddha and Christ, they all carry the keys to the secrets of the most varied mysteries. In March 2015, Artof4Elements developed and launched the Alchemy of Love Mindfulness Training Series of 9 fiction and non-fiction books with 7 authors focusing on spiritual growth, creativity and mindfulness.

Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life—having nothing but his own wits to help him along. Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village\'s wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man\'s (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram\'s new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (""Love -- Rape -- Revenge!""), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. Balram\'s eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn\'t create virtue, and money doesn\'t solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own.

We were seasonal workers during the late ‘70s and early ‘80s in Bournemouth. Many worked the deckchairs, some worked hotels, pubs, bars, or nightclubs, either as bar staff or bouncers. We lived off our wits and, yes, from time to time we were rogues, but we had each other’s backs and we had some laughs. This book recalls those days and tells the story of bringing a special group of people back together again after almost 40 years. And do you know what, it was as if we hadn’t skipped a beat. There were even people who’d missed each other first time around, yet all of us have a very rare and exceptional connection. It’s pure magic. Now if you’re reading the above and are thinking this was some kind of school reunion with a bunch of old codgers on Zimmer fames, playing inflatable ball games and drinking Dandelion & Burdock, mate, you’ve got it all wrong! If you’ve worked holiday towns as a seasonal worker, either in the UK or abroad, then you’ll ‘get it’ or if you’re looking to work a season in Spain or Portugal or the South coast of England, then these are the tough but crazy times you can expect. I’ve always loved wild people and wild places, always been drawn to them, and here are some of the stories. Now, for the first time ever, I think I understand what was so special about those years. Yes, at times they were tough, but we stuck with each other through thick and thin, and especially afterwards when we travelled the globe together. We’re not crazy, none of us (well, those in prison and mental asylums might be), but none of us on the ‘out’ are, but we had lively, buoyant and animated fun. We were carefree at an age when you’re supposed to be carefree. The flip side of this, I’m well aware, is that at times it may make some of us feel as if we’re outsiders, a lone wolf so to speak. People occasionally talk about us in hushed tones, whispering that we’re a bit of a loose cannon. They don’t really want to say it to our faces because every now and again we can still be a little unpredictable. But they look at us with a strange curiosity, because in comparison – although they’re often very successful at ‘fitting in’ – they lead lives that are drab, dreary and monotonous. They’re not unruly like you and me. And it’s that unruliness which has kept us young. These are the stories, some told in very funny poetic format, of those years. This book has been published for the people who shared those years to be able to keep a record. If you weren’t around on the south coast during the late 70’s and early 80’s I’d honestly give this book a miss. That’s as honest as we can get, because you won’t know the people involved, and it’s unlikely you’ll ‘get it’ Some of us, you see, weren’t meant to be tamed. We weren’t meant to be pacified or subdued. We were meant to run free until we discovered others just as wild to run with. And after all we’ve been through, we’re still standing and we’re still laughing out loud. And that bothers some people. Danny and I wish to dedicate this book to all who couldn’t be there on the night. Some are living abroad, some are in prison, others in mental institutions, and some have passed on. This isn’t anything morbid. We just want to remember the laughs they gave us.

He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published.

Proud, grateful, and longing to be American, the Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant, gritty, soulful, and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. For sixty years they have been left alone, neglected and half-forgotten in a backwater of history. Now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end: once again the tides of history threaten to sweep them up and carry them off into the unknown. But homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. He and his half-Tlingit partner, Berko Shemets, can\'t catch a break in any of their outstanding cases. Landsman\'s new supervisor is the love of his life—and also his worst nightmare. And in the cheap hotel where he has washed up, someone has just committed a murder—right under Landsman\'s nose. Out of habit, obligation, and a mysterious sense that it somehow offers him a shot at redeeming himself, Landsman begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy. But when word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, Landsman soon finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, hopefulness, evil, and salvation that are his heritage—and with the unfinished business of his marriage to Bina Gelbfish, the one person who understands his darkest fears.

Investigators descended on the scene, but more than thirty years later, the mystery remains: Did someone purposefully set fire to the library—and if so, who?Weaving her lifelong love of books and reading into an investigation of the fire, award-winning New Yorker reporter and New York Times bestselling author Susan Orlean delivers a mesmerizing and uniquely compelling book that manages to tell the broader story of libraries and librarians in a way that has never been done before.In The Library Book, Orlean chronicles the LAPL fire and its aftermath to showcase the larger, crucial role that libraries play in our lives; delves into the evolution of libraries across the country and around the world, from their humble beginnings as a metropolitan charitable initiative to their current status as a cornerstone of national identity; brings each department of the library to vivid life through on-the-ground reporting; studies arson and attempts to burn a copy of a book herself; reflects on her own experiences in libraries; and reexamines the case of Harry Peak, the blond-haired actor long suspected of setting fire to the LAPL more than thirty years ago.Along the way, Orlean introduces us to an unforgettable cast of characters from libraries past and present—from Mary Foy, who in 1880 at eighteen years old was named the head of the Los Angeles Public Library at a time when men still dominated the role, to Dr. C.J.K. Jones, a pastor, citrus farmer, and polymath known as “The Human Encyclopedia” who roamed the library dispensing information; from Charles Lummis, a wildly eccentric journalist and adventurer who was determined to make the L.A. library one of the best in the world, to the current staff, who do heroic work every day to ensure that their institution remains a vital part of the city it serves.Brimming with her signature wit, insight, compassion, and talent for deep research, The Library Book is Susan Orlean’s thrilling journey through the stacks that reveals how these beloved institutions provide much more than just books—and why they remain an essential part of the heart, mind, and soul of our country. It is also a master journalist’s reminder that, perhaps especially in the digital era, they are more necessary than ever.', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': ""When I'm Gone"", 'author': 'Emily Bleeker', 'book summary': '\nDear Luke,First let me say—I love you...

Within his dramatic story are themes that capture the intellect and the emotions: crime and punishment, the relentless persecution of Valjean by Inspector Javert, the desperation of the prostitute Fantine, the amorality of the rogue Thénardier, and the universal desire to escape the prisons of our own minds.

Salinger', 'book summary': ""The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read."", 'characters': ['Holden Caulfield', 'Robert Ackley', 'Stradlater', 'Phoebe Caulfield', 'Allie Caulfield', 'D.B Caulfield', 'Sally Hayes']}","{'title': 'The Ragged Edge of Night', 'author': 'Olivia Hawker', 'book summary': 'For fans of All the Light We Cannot See, Beneath a Scarlet Sky, and The Nightingale comes an emotionally gripping, beautifully written historical novel about extraordinary hope, redemption, and one man’s search for light during the darkest times of World War II.Germany, 1942.

How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers.

Virtually every major author from science fiction’s fabled golden age—including Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, and Robert A. Heinlein—agreed that Clifford D. Simak was one of the greatest among them. Named Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America, the award-winning author created enduring visions of future worlds, perilous space explorations, and weird alien encounters as rich in emotion and humanity as they are in ingenious invention. This is an essential collection of short fiction from the remarkable mind and heart of a true giant of twentieth-century speculative fiction, featuring powerful examples of literary science fiction at its very best. \xa0 Beginning with the unforgettable title story—a wry and chilling horror tale about cloning and alien invasion that inspired the classic teleplay “The Duplicate Man” from the television series The Outer Limits—Simak propels the reader on a breathtaking journey across the galaxies and into the future. He then enthralls us with the strange chronicle of twin siblings, one tied to the Earth, the other drawn to the stars; imaginings of a volatile reunion of two former enemies who must join forces on Jupiter’s moon or face extinction; and the story of a house in the middle of nowhere that serves as a gateway back to prehistoric times. \xa0 With his wondrous tales of a journalist’s miraculous discovery of fairies and sprites in the world, a census three centuries in the making that uncovers an unknown leap forward in human evolution, and the nightmare realities of future elder care, Simak demonstrates once again that he is not only one of the greatest science fiction writers of the twentieth century, but also one of the greatest of all time.', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'Fantasy Lover (Hunter Legends Series #1)', 'author': 'Sherrilyn Kenyon', 'book summary': 'Cursed into an eternity of slavery by his own brother, Julian of Macedon has spent centuries in hell, where the only respite he knows is measured in a handful of weeks whenever he’s summoned through an arcane spell.

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells—taken without her knowledge—became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first “immortal” human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they’d weigh more than 50 million metric tons—as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb’s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the “colored” ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta’s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia — a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo — to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.Henrietta’s family did not learn of her “immortality” until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family — past and present — is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family—especially Henrietta’s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother’s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn’t her children afford health insurance?Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.', 'characters': []}","{'title': 'Something in the Water', 'author': 'Catherine Steadman', 'book summary': ""If you could make one simple choice that would change your life forever, would you?Erin is a documentary filmmaker on the brink of a professional breakthrough, Mark a handsome investment banker with big plans.

Sometimes they come across perfectly-preserved cities, but without a single inhabitant, and never a drop of rain. Worse still, they have no memory of their lives before the desert. Only at night, in dreams, do they recall fragments of their past identities.But night also brings the madness of the sandstorms, which jolt them out of one body and into another in a game of metaphysical musical chairs. In their disorientation and dysfunction, they have killed each other dozens of times, but they cannot die. Where are they? How can they escape?From this quest form, Stepan Chapman has fashioned a poignant and powerful story of redemption in which pathos is leavened by humor and pain is softened by comfort. It is the story of deranged angels, deadly music boxes, and cellular transformation. It is also the tale of Alex who wanted to be a machine, Naomi, who spent 20 years as a corpsicle, and Eva, who escaped the whale emperor of her native land.

But his writing talent goes much further. We Install offers a showcase of styles, from humor—in “Father of the Groom,” a scientist with a penchant for wild experimentation helps his love-struck son by synthesizing a wedding ring out of two carrots—to classic science fiction, as in the Hugo Award–winning “Down in the Bottomlands” and “Hoxbomb,” in which a regular guy just trying to make a living selling scooters has to deal with some very odd competition. The alternate history tale “Drang von Osten” begins on a bloody battlefield in World War II and ends somewhere quite different. In the brand-new “Logan’s Law,” a man discovers that sometimes, second chances really do work out.

It presents a detailed imaginative description of how the earth might look when viewed from the moon, and is considered the first serious scientific treatise on lunar astronomy. Carl Sagan and Isaac Asimov have referred to it as the first work of science fiction.Somnium began as a student dissertation in which Kepler defended the Copernican doctrine of the motion of the Earth, suggesting that an observer on the Moon would find the planet\'s movements as clearly visible as the Moon\'s activity is to the Earth\'s inhabitants. Nearly 20 years later, Kepler added the dream framework, and after another decade, he drafted a series of explanatory notes reflecting upon his turbulent career and the stages of his intellectual development. The book was edited by his heirs, including Jacob Bartsch, after Kepler\'s death in 1630, and was published posthumously in 1634.', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'Irreversible', 'author': 'Liz Maverick', 'book summary': 'Every day seems perfect to Kitty, but what she doesn-t know is that a villain has looped her reality-and only the Wire Crossers and the handsome time-anomaly specialist Q can save her.', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'The Slow Regard of Silent Things (The Kingkiller Chronicle, #2.5)', 'author': 'Patrick Rothfuss', 'book summary': 'Deep below the University, there is a dark place.

A young woman lives there, tucked among the sprawling tunnels of the Underthing, snug in the heart of this forgotten place.Her name is Auri, and she is full of mysteries.The Slow Regard of Silent Things is a brief, bittersweet glimpse of Auri’s life, a small adventure all her own. At once joyous and haunting, this story offers a chance to see the world through Auri’s eyes. And it gives the reader a chance to learn things that only Auri knows...In this book, Patrick Rothfuss brings us into the world of one of The Kingkiller Chronicle’s most enigmatic characters.

The marketing people aren’t going to like this. My editor is going to have a fit. But I’d rather be honest with you right out of the gate.First, if you haven’t read my other books, you don’t want to start here.My first two books are The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man’s Fear. If you’re curious to try my writing, start there. They’re the best introduction to my world. This book deals with Auri, one of the characters from that series. Without the context of those books, you’re probably going to feel pretty lost.Second, even if you have read my other books, I think it’s only fair to warn you that this is a bit of a strange story. I don’t go in for spoilers, but suffice to say that this one is ... different. It doesn’t do a lot of the things a classic story is supposed to do. And if you’re looking for a continuation of Kvothe’s storyline, you’re not going to find it here.On the other hand, if you’d like to learn more about Auri, this story has a lot to offer. If you love words and mysteries and secrets. If you’re curious about the Underthing and alchemy.

Nigel Sheldon, one of the founders of the Commonwealth, receives a visit from the Raiel—self-appointed guardians of the Void, the enigmatic construct at the core of the galaxy that threatens the existence of all that lives. The Raiel convince Nigel to participate in a desperate scheme to infiltrate the Void. \xa0 Once inside, Nigel discovers that humans are not the only life-forms to have been sucked into the Void, where the laws of physics are subtly different and mental powers indistinguishable from magic are commonplace. The humans trapped there are afflicted by an alien species of biological mimics—the Fallers—that are intelligent but merciless killers. \xa0 Yet these same aliens may hold the key to destroying the threat of the Void forever—if Nigel can uncover their secrets. As the Fallers’ relentless attacks continue, and the fragile human society splinters into civil war, Nigel must uncover the secrets of the Fallers—before he is killed by the very people he has come to save.Praise for The Abyss Beyond Dreams\n\xa0\n“The work of an author at the top of his game.”—Science Fiction and Fantasy World  \xa0 “Incredibly robust and exciting and rousing, sharing flavors of Jack Vance, John Wright, China Miéville, Orson Scott Card, and A.

From the deepest secrets of the past to the furthest flung visions of the future, Roxanne\'s life knows no boundaries except those she can imagine. But such power comes at a price: the life she might have led is forever lost to her, twisting away among the infinite threads of the Myriad. Roxanne finds herself isolated, unable to make lasting, meaningful relationships with friends, family, or strangers. Here, There & Everywhere is the story of one woman searching for herself, and for someone with whom to share her life. It is one story, and many stories - the jigsaw puzzle of a life, from youth to old age, projected against the backdrop of everything that ever was, might have been, and may yet be. Roxanne\'s adventures take her from Victorian England to Ancient Egypt, from the End of Time to the birth of The Beatles. Along the way, she encounters every method of time travel theoretically possible: Visser Wormholes and Tipler Cylinders; a mysterious substance called chronium; and the slow and steady path we all take, moving forward one day at a time. And somewhere in the endlessly splitting paths of the Myriad lies the secret of Roxann', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'Tales of the Minivandians (The Minivandians #1)', 'author': 'Tom Rogneby', 'book summary': '""The Minivandian is the warrior who values his home and hearth.

The Queen of Sheba, aware that Solomon is preparing to disrupt her country's frankincense trade due to her refusal of his multiple marriage proposals, sends her most trusted guard, Asmira, to kill Solomon and steal the ring. Meanwhile, Bartimaeus has been humiliated because of his misbehavior and forced to work for Solomon's henchman, Khaba, on his new temple. After an amusing incident in which Bartimaeus is caught in the form of a hippo while illegally using magic to lay stones for Solomon's temple, he is sent to hunt other creatures who are disrupting trade routes. He encounters Asmira, traveling to Jerusalem under an assumed identity to accomplish her mission. How Bartimaeus ends up as her servant, and what they discover about the truth of Solomon's power, makes this a delightful and fascinating book, and it's likely to bring new fans to the original series.

Remarkably strong, magically talented, a match for friend and foe alike, Guinevere has come into womanhood—and faces a new relationship with Lancelot that will lead to the sharp-edged triangle of legend. . . .Born of the Highlands, along Pictish shores washed by the icy North Sea, Guinevere, Queen of the Dragon People, has become a woman. She has taken the power offered to her by the Dragon Throne. Now there is no turning back. In order to protect her beloved homeland from the obscene greed of the Saxon raiders, Guinevere knows she must launch an attack. The sub-chiefs refuse to fall in line with her plans (because what does this young thing, barely a woman, know of warfare?) and give her an army of the useless, the outcast, the weakest of their young boys and girls. But the war party must proceed. If it fails, the command of both land and sea will fall to the enemy. Facing her first battle against the pirates on foreign shores, and backed only by a meager band of ill-equipped fighters, Guinevere calls upon the spirits of the dead to aid her in the attack. Diving into the dark, morbid depths, Guinevere suddenly understands more of hate, love, anger, and revenge than she has ever wanted to. But the power the dead provide comes at a severe price. If she makes it through the raid, she will be a changed woman, in more ways than she can possibly imagine. Further south, Black Leg, her childhood companion, sets out on his own. It is a quest to become a man—a man, he hopes, who will be worthy of the newly crowned Guinevere. A shapeshifter and the son of Guinevere’s adoptive man-wolf father, Black Leg (soon to be Lancelot) feels he has much to learn—and even more to prove. He discovers both his inner strength and an unmitigated passion when he meets the Lady of the Lake. But the trials of his journey— both mental and physical—turn out to be more perilous with each step. And when Lancelot and Guinevere are finally reunited, the consequences of both their ordeals will unleash a torrent of anguish and desire.With familiar names brilliantly repositioned for a new generation of Arthurian fans—evil Merlin, conniving Igrane, complex Lancelot, tainted Arthur, and of course, warrior Guinevere—Alice Borchardt’s creation stands as a testament to the power of imagination.From the Hardcover edition.', 'characters': 'No Characters Availible'}","{'title': 'It Lives Beneath (It Lives Anthology, #2)', 'author': 'Pixelberry Studios', 'book summary': 'Start your new life in the beautiful town of Pine Springs!
